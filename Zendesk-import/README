These are a series of scripts that will allow you to import your production XML back up of Zendesk to your Sandbox. Or you can pull a back up of you Sandbox and restore it after a deletion. 

The groups.py has to be run first because Organizations can be assigned to a group so in order create a org you have to be able to meet that dependency. The next script that has to be run is orgs.py that is because users have a org dependency. Then you can run users.py to import your users. 

There are a couple of gotcha when doing this. 

1. Groups with the same name will be created so it's possilbe to end up with two groups with the same name in the recieving end. A bug has been submitted to Zendesk. 

2. Deleted users have no email address so will cause the users.py to fail. So you will have to clean up the users.xml created in Zendesk before running the script. Just search for <email nil="true"></email> in the file and remove those records.
